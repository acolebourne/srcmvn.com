For the last few weeks I've been polishing [Embedded Composer](https://github.com/dflydev/dflydev-embedded-composer) for my talk at [Symfony Live 2013 in Portland](http://portland2013.live.symfony.com).

Embedded Composer started its life as a part of [Sculpin](https://sculpin.io) but was extracted so that other people could potentially use it. I'm hoping that Embedded Composer will help more people get interested in the idea of embedding Composer into their applications.

I'm super excited to have an opportunity to share this work with more people. I had a blast at Symfony Live 2012 in San Francisco. I'm hoping I can continue to attend these in the future.

I also took this opportunity to launch a new landing page for myself. [beau.io](https://beau.io) is now live and showcasing this talk. :)

I'd love to get feedback on the talk. :) If you saw it in person, please [rate my talk and provide some feedback](https://joind.in/8667). Otherwise, [please send me a Tweet](https://twitter.com/beausimensen)!
