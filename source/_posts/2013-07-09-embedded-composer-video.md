The fine folks at [SensioLabs](http://sensiolabs.com) have posted my [Embedded
Composer talk on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CSovVvRwXk)! I'd still
love to get feedback on the talk. :) If you saw it in person or later watched it
on YouTube, please let me know what you think. You can [send me a
Tweet](https://twitter.com/beausimensen) or find me on IRC as **simensen** on
Freenode!
