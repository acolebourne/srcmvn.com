The [fight](http://srcmvn.com/blog/2011/11/16/octopress-vs-jekyll-fight/)
is over. Neither [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)
nor [Octopress](http://octopress.org/) were victorious. I've
landed on something entirely different to power [srcmvn.com](http://srcmvn.com).
It is named [Sculpin](http://getsculpin.com).

Sculpin is my creation. I've been working on it since the
end of 2011 and am very excited to have been able to
convert my Octopress site over to the new system.

It still has a very long road ahead of it but it is already
powering a couple of sites. This site can now be added to
the list.
