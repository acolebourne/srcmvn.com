I don't know exactly when I first started working on [Sculpin][1] but the
first [commit][2] to the [1.0][3] branch was made exactly one year ago today.
I wanted to do something special to celebrate but time has run out.

So, **happy birthday Sculpin!** It has been a crazy year. Thanks for the fun
times and for providing interesting problems to solve. :)
