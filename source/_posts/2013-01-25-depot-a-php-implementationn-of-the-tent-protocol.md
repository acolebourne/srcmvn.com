I have been interested in decentralized social networks for awhile now.
It wasn't until recently that I found a project I could really get behind.
That project is [Tent][1].

After idling on [tent.is][2] for several months and watching in envy
as the likes of [@beberlei][3] showed off projects like [Zelten][4] I
finally decided to throw my hat in the ring.

My contribution is coming in the form of [Depot][5], a PHP implementation
of the Tent protocol. I have some lofty goals that I won't go into just
yet. I am bound to share here in the future but in the meantime check out
[Depot][5]'s project site and its [repository on GitHub][6] for more
details.

I'm hoping to use this project to try out some new ideas and refine some
existing patterns. It should be a lot of fun and I'm very much looking
forward to it!
